# Introduction to Web Accessibility
Slides and materials are hosted at [http://girldevelopit.github.io/girldevelopit-rdu-access/](http://girldevelopit.github.io/girldevelopit-rdu-access/).

This is the official Girl Develop It Web Accessibility curriculum. This is a four-hour course, divided into two two-hour sessions. It was originally developed by Sylvia Pellicore, with additional content from Aisha Blake. An update by Marcy Sutton converted it to a two-week class. There are four components: the course slides (class1.html and class2.html), a class activity handout (kitten-alt-text.pdf), an HTML/CSS demo with two parts (demo.html and demo.css), and an instructor guide (Instructor Guide.docx).

## Course description
Who can use your websites? Are they accessible to as many people as possible?

Web accessibility has traditionally described the process of enhancing websites for people with disabilities. Come to this class to learn more about developing with accessibility in mindâ€”and building a better web experience for everyone.

This two-week class will focus on general design principles, with some hands-on exercises. It is helpful to have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. You should also plan to bring a laptop and some headphones to work along with the class.

### Prerequisites:
You should have:
(a) taken Intro to HTML/CSS through Girl Develop It, or
(b) be familiar with the basics of HTML and CSS

### Tech requirements:
 - Your laptop (Mac, PC, or Linux are all okay).
 - A modern web browser - either Chrome or Firefox.
 - A text editor. We recommend Sublime Text 2 (free; available for Mac, PC, and Linux).
 - A set of headphones or earbuds

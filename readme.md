# Introduction to Web Accessibility
Slides and materials are hosted at [https://gdichicago.github.io/web-accessibility/](https://gdichicago.github.io/web-accessibility/).

This is the official Girl Develop It Web Accessibility curriculum. This is a four-hour course, divided into two two-hour sessions. It was originally developed by Sylvia Pellicore, with additional content from Aisha Blake. An update by Marcy Sutton converted it to a two-week class. There are four components: the course slides (class1.html and class2.html), a class activity handout (kitten-alt-text.pdf), an HTML/CSS demo with two parts (demo.html and demo.css), and an instructor guide (Instructor Guide.docx).
